# Examproject

Data project:
This project investigates whether it is possible to invest in certain green indexes and still obtain reasonable returns. We do this by comparing the Invesco Global Clean Energy index and the S&P Clean Energy index to investing in a market index as SP500 or a controversial oil company as ExxonMobil over the 5 year period 2014-2019. Specifically, we use descriptive statistics including measures of variability (risk).

Data sources:
In this project all the data is accessed through the following sources' APIs:
- The Investors Exchange (IEX)
- Federal Reserve Bank of ST.LOUIS.

Imported Python libraries:
We use the following packages: Pandas, pandas_datareader, datetime, matplotlib.pyplot and stats (from scipy). These should be imported in order to run the remaining code in the notebook.

Model project: 
In our model projecy we study a Solow model with fossil fuels and a climate externality. The motivation for this project is to analyze long-term growth in th presence of finite resources and a negative externality from previously utilized ressources.

Imported Python libraries:
We use the following packages: import numpy as np from scipy import linalg from scipy import optimize as opt from scipy.ndimage.interpolation import shift import sympy as sm import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt sm.init_printing(pretty_print = True) from ipywidgets import interact, interactive, fixed, interact_manual import ipywidgets as widgets import matplotlib.animation as animation from matplotlib.widgets import Slider.


Exam project:
Imported Python libraries:
import numpy as np, import scipy as sp, %matplotlib inline, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, from scipy import interpolate, 
from scipy import stats, from scipy import optimize, import sympy as sm, import pandas as pd, from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D 
from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
