# Dataproject : Can you save the climate along with your pension? 


This project investigates whether it is possible to invest in certain green indexes and still obtain reasonable returns. We do this by comparing the Invesco Global Clean Energy index and the S&P Clean Energy index to investing in a market index as SP500 or a controversial oil company as ExxonMobil over the 5 year period 2014-2019. Specifically, we use descriptive statistics including measures of variability (risk). 

Data sources: 

In this project all the data is accessed through the following sources' APIs: 
 - The Investors Exchange (IEX)
 - Federal Reserve Bank of ST.LOUIS.
 
Imported Python libraries: 

In the beginning of our Jupyter notebook project file we import pandas, pandas_datareader, datetime, matplotlib.pyplot and stats (from scipy). These should be imported in order to run the remaining code in the notebook.
